#summary This is the overview page for how the quests module in Hitch is planned to work.

= Introduction =

The Hitch Quests module will help you manage quests between multiple toons when multiboxing.  

= Details =

Phase 1: What do I want the quests module to do, baseline?

  * Share a quest between all team members
  * Auto-accept quests from other team members
  * ?Possible to auto-complete quests?  --check events to see if there's a way to turn quests in without alt-tabbing to activate the npc; some way to communicate that action between toons via the addon channel?  Probably not, too close to botting... still, worth checking. Maybe look at some of the daily quest auto-turn-in addons, see what they're hooking.

Phase 2:

  * do I want to do some sort of quest tracking, to help see where I missed a step on a chain with which character?  Maybe some sort of quest completed log?  That might be a bit ambitious, and possibly redundant to the WoWHead quest stuff & Bliz XML feed.
