They exist so that people who are very good at math and care a lot about the statistical distribution of their random mount/companion selection can fiddle with it to their hearts' content.  The rest of us just don't need to worry about it.  :-)\n\nIf you're curious, though, feel free to play around and see how it works (that's why there's a reset button here).  Basically, Doolittle first chooses which rating level it's going to pick from (and the more \"weight\" a rating has, the more often that rating level will be chosen).  Then, it chooses randomly from all the mounts/companions which have that rating (each one is equally likely), so if you have (for example) a lot 4-star mounts and very few 3-star mounts, |cffffff00each|r 4-four star mount might come up less often than each 3-star mount, but the total chance of getting |cffffff00any|r four-star mount is still higher than the total chance of getting any 3-star mount as long as the 4-star rating has a higher weight than the 3-star rating.\n\nSee why I told you not to worry about it?"
