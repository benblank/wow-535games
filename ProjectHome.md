This project consists of a series of addons for World of Warcraft, each of which is designed to be small, lightweight, and unintrusive.

Our two flagship addons, Doolittle and Junkyard, are nearing their 1.0 releases â€” watch for them on WoW Interface soon, or download a beta version and help us get there!

Addons from 535games:
| [Doolittle](Doolittle.md) | Beta | Helps you manage your mount and companion collections with "star ratings", weighted randomization, and auto-selection of appropriate mount types and speeds. |
|:--------------------------|:-----|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Junkyard](Junkyard.md)   | Stable | Makes cleaning out your bags a snap with automatic junk detection (grey items, unequippable quest rewards, etc.), plus "always sell" and "never sell" lists.  Also handles other minor inventory-related tasks like equipment repair. |
| [Ovation](Ovation.md)     | Planned | A minor upgrade for the reputation window.  Auto-track changing reputations, auto-ignore Exalted factions, and more.                                         |
